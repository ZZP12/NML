m_ & p_ & mRNA_ & g_ are METABOLITE, PROTEIN, MRNA, GENE
_e, _c are _exc, _c


# m_a_c, m_b_c and m_c_c upregulate the expression of P_D_C
# m_a_c or m_b_c and m_c_c upregulate the expression of P_D_C
m_a_c or (m_b_c and m_c_c) upregulate the expression of p_D_C
# m_a_c and (m_b_c and m_c_c) upregulate the expression of P_D_C

# the cell uptakes m_D_e  via p_F_c and p_F_e reversibly
# m_D_e reacts into [] irreversibly
# [] activates the expression of g_jlj_c

p_D_c catalyzes the reversible conversion of m_acald_c, m_coa_c and m_nad_c into m_accoa_c, m_h_c and m_nadh_c
