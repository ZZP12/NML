# cheme7770 demonstration example

the cell uptakes met_A_e
p_E_c catalyzes the conversion of met_A_c into met_B_c
the cell secretes met_B_c
p_C_c activates p_E_c
p_C_c reacts into []

met_, p_, mRNA_, g_ are METABOLITE, PROTEIN, MRNA, GENE
_e, _c are _exc, _c


# bug to fix

# --> a workable and stable compiler needs to consider all possible errors?
# --> underestimate the workload
