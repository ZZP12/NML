# bmc three gene network
the cell uptakes met_A_e via p_TA_c
the cell secretes met_B_c via p_TB_c
the cell secretes met_C_c via p_TC_c
p_E1_c catalyzes the conversion of met_A_c into met_B_c
p_E4_c catalyzes the conversion of met_B_c into met_A_c
p_E2_c catalyzes the conversion of met_A_c into met_C_c
p_E3_c catalyzes the conversion of met_C_c into met_B_c

met_A_e activates p_TA_c
met_A_c induces g_E1_c and g_E2_c
met_B_c induces g_TB_c and g_E4_c
met_C_c induces g_E3_c and g_TC_c


met_, p_, mRNA_, g_ are METABOLITE, PROTEIN, MRNA, GENE
_e, _c are _exc, _c
